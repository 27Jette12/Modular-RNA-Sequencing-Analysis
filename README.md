# Modular-RNA-Sequencing-Analysis
A modular R-based RNA-Seq analysis pipeline. Starting from a count file or rsem output, the pipeline can be used for merging RSEM outputs, normalization (VST/QN), visualization (PCA, heatmaps, boxplots), differential expression analysis (DESeq2)and pathway and gene-level exploration.
